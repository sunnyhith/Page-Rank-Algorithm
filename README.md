Implemented Page Rank algorithm to develop an application using JFrames where, given a set of nodes (web pages) and references between them (hyperlink network) calculates the effective page rank value.

PageRank_Final.java :

This is a JFrame which initially takes in the number of pages, and sends this along with connections between them to the program "PageRank_User.java" where the actual page rank values are being calculated.

PageRank_User.java :
